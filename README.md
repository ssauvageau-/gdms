The Grim Dawn Modding Suite (GDMS) is a comprehensive tool for developing mods for Grim Dawn. It features the means to quickly find desired occurrences of certain patterns in vanilla Grim Dawn content, check for common bugs within a mod, remove extraneous files from a mod that have not changed compared to vanilla content, and serves as a hub for the modding tools provided by Crate Entertainment.

GDMS has been designed with future-proofing in mind, to the point that it is compatible with the yet-unreleased third expansion, Fangs of Asterkarn, without compromising toolkit functionality in the expansionâ€™s absence.

Version 0.9+ of the mod has been built from the ground up with the intent to modernize the mod suite while maintaining original toolkit features and looks. Moreover, all features are many orders of magnitude faster than earlier versions of the suite, with countless optimizations and techniques implemented to streamline the use of its tools.

Please refer to the attached manual for a comprehensive look at the many features offered by GDMS, as well as specific instructions for using each one.
